### There are many deep learning fremworks available for you to use. Need a mid sized CNN for binary classification?- Sure. Go for PyTorch. Need a huge gpt4 sized llvm? Again, go for PyTorch. This is clearly the best way! Or is it?

# The choice.
### Does it matter whether one use Tensorflow, Pytorch, Jax or Flux.jl? Well, it **does**. In fact there are many differences!
# However
## The thing that matters **the most** is:
# **Do you understand the underlying math and low level operations?**

## **Sweating profusely**
# Do I?
## **tiniergrad.jl** is merely a proof of concept.- The concept being a **deep** understanding of even **deeper** principles of **deep** learning math.

### Hoping that one day those julia lines might help an innocent soul grasp the math behind mlp and cnn operations!
